For scalar multiplication, although the student didn't explicitly show it in their answer, it can be shown that ϕ3(kf)(x) = ∫[0,x] (kf(t)) dt = k∫[0,x] f(t) dt = kϕ3(f)(x).

This property states that for any scalar k and any vector v, the transformation of the scalar multiple kv is equal to the scalar multiple of the transformation of v. In other words, T(kv) = kT(v).
