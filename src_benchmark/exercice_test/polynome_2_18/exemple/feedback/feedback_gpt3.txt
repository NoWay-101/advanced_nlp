The answer provided by the student is not entirely correct. They made several mistakes in their calculations and did not fully complete the exercise.

Here are the specific errors:

1. In the calculation of P(i), the student did not correctly apply the exponentiation of i. They incorrectly wrote i^4 as i^2, i^3 as -i, and i^2 as -1. The correct calculations should be:

P(i) = i^4 - 5i^3 + 7i^2 - 5i + 6
      = (i^2)^2 - 5(i^2)(i) + 7(i^2) - 5i + 6
      = (-1)^2 - 5(-1)i + 7(-1) - 5i + 6
      = 1 + 5i - 7 - 5i + 6
      = 0

Therefore, P(i) = 0, not 19 - 5i as the student stated.

2. The student incorrectly calculated i to be 19/5 as a root. This is incorrect. The correct value for i as a root is i, not 19/5.

3. In the calculation of the factorization of P on C, the student attempted to use synthetic division but made several errors. They did not correctly perform the division and mistakenly included i^2 instead of -1 in one of the terms.

The correct factorization of P on C should be:

P(X) = (X - i)(X + i)(X - 2)(X - 3)

Therefore, the student's answer is not correct, and they made several errors in their calculations and factorization.
