The student's answer provides a correct explanation of the problem and the steps to determine the roots and poles of the rational expression. The student correctly identifies the roots as the p-th roots of unity (excluding 1) and the poles as the q-th roots of unity (excluding 1).

However, there is one mistake in the student's answer. The student states that the multiplicity of each root and pole is 1. This is incorrect. The correct statement is that all the roots and poles have multiplicity 1 except for the root 1, which has multiplicity p-1.

Apart from this mistake, the student's explanation is clear and accurate.
