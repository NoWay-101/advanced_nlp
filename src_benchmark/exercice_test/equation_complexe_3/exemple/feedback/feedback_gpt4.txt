The student's answer is not entirely correct. They made some mistakes in their calculations which led to incorrect results for both systems. Here are the main issues:

For System 1:
The student correctly used the elimination method in the beginning, but made an error when simplifying the equation. Instead of ending up with the equation "3z1 + iz2 = 15i - 4", the student should have ended up with the correct equation "3z1 + iz2 = -17 + i", which is the same as in the official correction.

The correct solution for System 1 is: z1 = 1 + 3i and z2 = 2 + 5i

For System 2:
The student made an error while trying to isolate z2 by using the second equation; the correct expression should have been z2 = (11i - iz1) / 2. This error also led to a wrong expression for z2 when trying to substitute it back into the equation. Consequently, the student's calculations for both z1 and z2 are incorrect.

The correct solution for System 2 is: z1 = 1 - 4i and z2 = -2 + 5i

So, the student's answer is incorrect, and they need to revise their calculations and follow the official corrections for each system to arrive at the correct solutions.
