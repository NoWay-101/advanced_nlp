The student's answer is mostly correct. The student correctly concluded that ϕ1 is not a linear transformation, and they showed the correct reasoning. The student also concluded that ϕ3 is a linear transformation, and their reasoning is correct and consistent with the official correction.

However, there is a small mistake in the student's reasoning for ϕ2. The student correctly found that ϕ2(f + g)(x) = ϕ2(f)(x) + ϕ2(g)(x), but they did not check the second property of linearity, which involves scalar multiplication. According to the official correction, ϕ2 also satisfies this property:

ϕ2(λf)(x) = (λf)(x^2) = λf(x^2) = λϕ2(f)(x).

Since both properties of linearity are satisfied for ϕ2, the student's conclusion that ϕ2 is a linear transformation is correct, but their reasoning was incomplete.
