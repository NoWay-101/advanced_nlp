To determine if a matrix is invertible, we need to calculate its determinant. If the determinant is non-zero, then the matrix is invertible.

Let's calculate the determinant for each matrix:

For matrix A:
A =
⎛
⎜
⎝
1 1 2 
1 2 1 
2 1 1 
⎞
⎟
⎠

We can calculate the determinant by using the formula:

det(A)
