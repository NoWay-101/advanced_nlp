The student's answer is incorrect. They made a mistake in simplifying the expressions.

For the first expression, the student simplified it to: 3B + AB + 2A^(-1)AB - In + B^(-1)B - AB^2

However, the correct simplification is: 4B

For the second expression, the student simplified it to: 5A - AIn + AB^(-1)

However, the correct simplification is: -BA + AB

Therefore, the student made errors in both expressions.
