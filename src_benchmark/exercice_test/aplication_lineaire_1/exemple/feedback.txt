The student's answer for the first function is correct.

However, the student's answer for the second function is incorrect. The student claims that the second function satisfies both additivity and homogeneity and is a linear application. But the second function is actually not a linear application.

To illustrate why the second function is not linear, let's check the homogeneity property. When we apply the scalar multiplication, we find:

f(ku) = f(kx, ky) = (k(x + y), k(x - 2y), 1)
k*f(u) = k*(x + y, x - 2y, 1) = (k(x + y), k(x - 2y), k)

Since f(ku) ≠ k*f(u) (because 1 ≠ k), the second function does not satisfy the homogeneity property. Therefore, it is not a linear application.

The student did provide the correct answer for the third function, which is not a linear application.

In summary:
- The first function is a linear application.
- The second function is not a linear application, contrary to the student's claim.
- The third function is not a linear application, as the student correctly identified.
