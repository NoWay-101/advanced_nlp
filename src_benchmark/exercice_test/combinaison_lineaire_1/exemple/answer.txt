To determine if a vector u can be written as a linear combination of vectors u1, u2, u3, etc., we need to check if there exist coefficients (a, b, c, ...) such that the equation au1 + bu2 + cu3 + ... = u holds.

Let's solve the given problems one by one:

1) For E = R^2, u = (1, 2), u1 = (1, -2), u2 = (2, 3):

We need to find coefficients a and b such that au1 + bu2 = u.
Let's set up the system of equations:
a(1, -2) + b(2, 3) = (1, 2)

Simplifying the equations, we get:
a + 2b = 1   -> (1)
-2a + 3b = 2  -> (2)

Solving this system of equations, we find:
a = 1/7, b = 3/7

Therefore, u can be expressed as a linear combination of u1 and u2.

2) For E = R^2, u = (1, 2), u1 = (1, -2), u2 = (2, 3), u3 = (-4, 5):

Similarly, we need to find coefficients a, b, and c such that au1 + bu2 + cu3 = u.

Setting up the system of equations:
a(1, -2) + b(2, 3) + c(-4, 5) = (1, 2)

Simplifying the equations, we get:
a + 2b - 4c = 1   -> (3)
-2a + 3b + 5c = 2  -> (4)

Solving this system of equations, we find:
a = 3/5, b = 7/5, c = 1/5

Therefore, u can be expressed as a linear combination of u1, u2, and u3.

3) For E = R^3, u = (2, 5, 3), u1 = (1, 3, 2), u2 = (1, -1, 4):

We need to find coefficients a and b such that au1 + bu2 = u.
Setting up the system of equations:
a(1, 3, 2) + b(1, -1, 4) = (2, 5, 3)

Simplifying the equations, we get:
a + b = 2    -> (5)
3a - b = 5   -> (6)
2a + 4b = 3  -> (7)

Solving this system of equations, we find:
a = 2, b = 0

Therefore, u cannot be expressed as a linear combination of u1 and u2.

4) For E = R^3, u = (3, 1, m), u1 = (1, 3, 2), u2 = (1, -1, 4):

We need to find coefficients a and b such that au1 + bu2 = u.

For u = (3, 1, m), the corresponding equations become:
a(1, 3, 2) + b(1, -1, 4) = (3, 1, m)

Simplifying the equations, we get:
a + b = 3   -> (8)
3a - b = 1  -> (9)
2a + 4b = m -> (10)

To determine if u can be expressed as a linear combination of u1 and u2, we need to solve the system of equations (8), (9), and (10) for m.

Solving this system of equations, we find that m = 19.

Therefore, u can be expressed as a linear combination of u1 and u2 when m = 19.
