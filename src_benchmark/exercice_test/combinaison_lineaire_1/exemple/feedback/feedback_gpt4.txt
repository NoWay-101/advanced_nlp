The student's answer is mostly correct, but there are a few minor errors in their calculations:

1) In the first problem, the values calculated for a and b are correct (a = 1/7, b = 3/7), and the conclusion is correct that u is a linear combination of u1 and u2.

2) In the second problem, the calculated values for a, b, and c are incorrect (3/5, 7/5, 1/5). However, the conclusion that u is a linear combination of u1, u2, and u3 is still correct, as seen in the official correction.

3) In the third problem, the student correctly concluded that u cannot be expressed as a linear combination of u1 and u2, as the system of equations is inconsistent.

4) In the fourth problem, the student's main error is the value of m. They calculated m as 19, whereas the official correction calculates m as 10. The correct conclusion should be that u can be expressed as a linear combination of u1 and u2 when m = 10.

To sum up, the student's answer is mostly correct, but there are some mistakes in the calculations, particularly in problems 2 and 4. The conclusions for problems 1 and 3 are correct.
